# Welcome to Duo Date ðŸ‘‹
Duo Date is a cross-platform dating app designed to bring a fun, social twist to modern dating by connecting users through double date experiences. The idea was born during my time living in a fraternity house, where double dating was a popular and light-hearted way to meet new people. Duo Date aims to capture that same energyâ€”making dating more casual, enjoyable, and collaborative.

### The application is currently in development, having commenced on March 1, 2025. We are targeting a launch date of May 1, 2025.

## Market Research Summary
To better understand user behavior and pain points within existing dating platforms, we conducted initial market research through surveys. While our [**data**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I2ew081agHtjG6l2BxVN8d2INgmomewX4LE6nz1BH1Q/edit?usp=sharing) was limited, the insights gathered allowed us to extrapolate key trends and refine our product direction.
### Key Insights:
- A **majority of respondents expressed interest** in a double-dating format.
- Willingness to pay for dating apps was **generally low**.
- Primary concerns included:
     - Emotional/Psychological stressors (e.g., rejection anxiety, mental health fatigue)
     - Dissatisfaction with experience (e.g., low match quality, ghosting)
     - Safety and Security (e.g., harassment, identity concerns)
- While **Most users are open to both types of relationship**, **most active users gravitated toward short-term interactions**.
- **Some users engage with dating apps socially, while physically together.**
### Implications for Product Development:
- A duo-based dating experience may inherently reduce psychological stress and rejection anxiety by involving a trusted friend.
- This format can also bolster user safety by encouraging social accountability and shared decision-making.
- User dissatisfaction signals an opportunity to improve core experience through thoughtful design, taking inspiration from successful, user-centric platforms.
- We will explore features that enhance in-app collaboration, such as **shared feeds** or "duo bios."
- Users should be able to designated default duo date partner. Similar to SnapChats BFF option. 

These insights continue to guide our feature development and validation efforts as we build a dating app designed to foster safer, more emotionally supportive interactions.
